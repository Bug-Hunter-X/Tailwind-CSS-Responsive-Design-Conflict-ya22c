This solution demonstrates how to resolve the responsiveness issue by carefully structuring the Tailwind classes or using more explicit CSS.  The key is to avoid overlapping or conflicting directives, and to ensure a clear hierarchy of styles for each breakpoint:

```html
<!-- responsive-solution.html -->
<div class="lg:flex hidden items-center justify-around space-x-4 p-4 bg-gray-100">
  <div class="w-16 h-16 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class="w-16 h-16 bg-green-500"></div>
  <div class="w-16 h-16 bg-red-500"></div>
</div>
```
This uses `lg:flex` to show the element only on large screens.  The other classes (`hidden`, `items-center`, etc.) then apply conditionally.  It avoids the ambiguity and conflict present in the original buggy implementation.
